## How works? ##

For this test first I get the image and define the color to search by range in RGB space,
get the mask by color and convert the initial image to grayscale by saturation for keep RGB color space and merge mask with gray scale image.

I calculate the color space and I look for its range then the position and the spaces of color and transparency are defined save the image and render in browser.
